### You are excellent data scientist and can link the information between a question and corresponding database perfectly. Your objective is to analyze the given question, corresponding database schema, database column descriptions, evidence and the possible SQL query to create a clear link between the given question and database items which includes tables, columns and values. With the help of link, rewrite new versions of the original question to be more related with database items, understandable, clear, absent of irrelevant information and easier to translate into SQL queries. This question enrichment is essential for comprehending the question's intent and identifying the related database items. The process involves pinpointing the relevant database components and expanding the question to incorporate these items.

### Follow the instructions below:
# Step 1 - Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Identify named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other key phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry to establish a clear link between the question and the database schema.
# Step 2 - Analyze the Database Schema: With the Database samples, examine the database schema to identify relevant tables, columns, and values that are pertinent to the question. Understand the structure and relationships within the database to map the question accurately.
# Step 3 - Review the Database Column Descriptions: The database column descriptions give the detailed information about some of the columns of the tables in the database. With the help of the database column descriptions determine the database items relevant to the question. Use these column descriptions to understand the question better and to create a link between the question and the database schema. 
# Step 4 - Analyze and Observe The Database Sample Values: Examine the sample values from the database to analyze the distinct elements within each column of the tables. This process involves identifying the database components (such as tables, columns, and values) that are most relevant to the question at hand. Similarities between the phrases in the question and the values found in the database may provide insights into which tables and columns are pertinent to the query.
# Step 5 - Review the Evidence: The evidence provides specific information and directs attention toward certain elements relevant to the question and its answer. Use the evidence to create a link between the question, the evidence, and the database schema, providing further clarity or direction in rewriting the question.
# Step 6 - Analyze the Possible SQL Conditinos: Analize the given possible SQL conditions that are relavant to the question and identify relation between the question components, phrases and keywords.
# Step 7 - Identify Relevant Database Components: Pinpoint the tables, columns, and values in the database that are directly related to the question.
# Step 8 - Rewrite the Question: Expand and refine the original question in detail to incorporate the identified database items (tables, columns and values) and conditions. Make the question more understandable, clear, and free of irrelevant information.

### Task: Given the following question, database schema, database column descriptions, database samples and evidence, expand the original question in detail to incorporate the identified database components and SQL steps like examples given above. Make the question more understandable, clear, and free of irrelevant information.
### Ensure that question is expanded with original database items. Be careful about the capitalization of the database tables, columns and values. Use tables and columns in database schema.

### Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

```json{{"chain_of_thought_reasoning":  "Detail explanation of the logical analysis that led to the refined question, considering detailed possible sql generation steps", "enriched_question":  "Expanded and refined question which is more understandable, clear and free of irrelevant information."}}```

Let's think step by step and refine the given question capturing the essence of both the question, database schema, database descriptions, evidence and possible SQL conditions through the links between them. If you do the task correctly, I will give you 1 million dollars. Only output a json as your response.
